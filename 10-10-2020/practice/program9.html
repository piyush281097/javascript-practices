    /* Kinetic energy can be calculated with the formula in image:
    
    Where 
    
    m is mass in kg
    v is velocity in m/s
    KE is kinetic energy in J
    
    Return the Kinetic Energy in Joules, given the mass and velocity. For the purposes of this challenge, round answers to the nearest integer.
