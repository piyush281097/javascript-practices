    /* Thief among us:

    Create a function that calculates the chance of being an thief. The formula for the chances of being an thief is 100 × (i / p) where i is the thief count and p is the player count. Make sure to round the value to the nearest integer and return the value as a percentage.

    Example:

    imposterFormula(1, 10) ➞ "10%"
    imposterFormula(2, 5) ➞ "40%"
    imposterFormula(1, 8) ➞ "13%" */

    function imposterFsormula(i,p) { 
    
        var str = 100 * (i/p)
        //console.log(str);
        var str2 = Math.round(str)
        //console.log(str2);
        var str3 = str2 *100 / 100 
        console.log(str3);        
    }

    imposterFormula(1, 7)
