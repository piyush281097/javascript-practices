    /* Extract City Data

    Create a function that takes an object as an argument and returns a string with facts about the city. The city facts will need to be extracted from the object's three properties:

    1. name
    2. population
    3. continent

    The string should have the following format: X has a population of Y and is situated in Z 

    where X is the city name, Y is the population and Z is the continent the city is situated in.

    cityFacts({
        name: "Paris",
        population: "2,140,526",
        continent: "Europe"
    }) ➞ "Paris has a population of 2,140,526 and is situated in Europe"

    cityFacts({
        name: "Tokyo",
        population: "13,929,286",
        continent: "Asia"
    }) ➞ "Tokyo has a population of 13,929,286 and is situated in Asia" */
    function cityFact(cityFacts) {
    
        console.log(cityFacts.name +" has a population of "+cityFacts.population+" and is situated in "+cityFacts.continent);   
    
    }
    
    cityFact(cityFacts  ={
        name: "Tokyo",
        population: "13,929,286",
        continent: "Asia"
